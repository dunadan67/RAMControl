In this part of the session, you will see words
one at a time on the computer screen.
Some words will be 'OLD' words that you saw during
the lists you studied earlier.
Some words will be 'NEW' words that you did not see
during the previous study lists.
Your job is to press a button to indicate if the word
is OLD or NEW.

Press {recognition_yes_key:s} if the word is OLD.
Press {recognition_no_key:s} if the word is NEW.

Please ask the experimenter if you have any questions.

Press any key to begin.
