RAM 3.0 Task Laptop code
========================

Basic setup
-----------

.. note:: This section is somewhat incomplete. See the RAM Task Laptop
          Test Procedure and Report document on Box for more complete
          (but possibly somewhat outdated) instructions.

First run the PyEPL installer. If you don't know how to do this, talk
to Isaac.

Clone this repository to a sensible place, e.g.,
``~/src/task_laptop/ram_tasks``. Next clone the ``RAM_FR`` repository and make
sure that the ``run_FRx`` scripts correctly point to this directory.
